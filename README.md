# html-parser

command line tool that parses html. Using as a vehicle to learn swift, potentially a scraper to mine data.

## How I created this

-  created project on github
-  git clone
-  swift package init --type executable
-  swift build
-  swift run

## Constraints

These are artificial contraints so I can focus on learning swift the language and not be distracted by apple tech. Will add in xcode, swiftui, etc as I learn

-  Swift
-  VSCode, commandline/terminal

## Next steps

-  download html page using
   -  async await?
   -  NIO?
   -  get raw html, echo to cli
-  Start recursive tag parser, learn from that,
-  Pass url on command line
