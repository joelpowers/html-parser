# html-parser

Pivot - SwiftSoup looks like a full feature html parser. Will use it as a scrapper - financial data and/or sports scores

## How I created this

-  created project on github
-  git clone
-  swift package init --type executable
-  swift build
-  swift run

## Constraints

These are artificial contraints so I can focus on learning swift the language and not be distracted by apple tech. Will add in xcode, swiftui, etc as I learn

-  Swift
-  VSCode, commandline/terminal

## Next steps

-  figure out how to wait for a task to complete in cli app
-  parse out ncaa football scores
-  Using way old version of swiftsoup - update
